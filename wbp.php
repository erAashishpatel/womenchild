</br>Feeling Sick: Nausea and Vomiting
</br>Feeling sick ? </br>You’re not alone! Many women experience nausea and vomiting during their
pregnancy.That’s because changes in hormones </br>can make you feel sick to your stomach.
Certain smells and movements can make the nausea worse.The good news is that the nausea
usually disappears after the first trimester.
To help cope with nausea and vomiting , you can
avoid having an empty stomach.
Eat whatever food </br>appeals to you in frequent small amounts until you are feeling better.
Get out of bed slowly and eat soon afterward.
Drink fluids between </br>meals and not with meals.
Choose cold foods(with less smell) or get someone else to do the cooking if possible.
Try smelling fresh-cut lemon.
Avoid smoke , strong odours , alcohol and caffeine.</br><a  href="h1.php">Hindi translator voice</a></br><a  href="1.php">English translator voice</a>

hormone changes during pregnancy that allow stomach acid to move up to your throat.

Do not lie down after eating.
When you do lie down,raise your head and shoulders.
Avoid fried or greasy foods.
Drink fluids between meals,not with meals.
Avoid coffee , colas , alcohol and smoking.

of acid in your stomach.Not all antacids are safe for pregnant women.Check with your doctor
or health care provider</br> before you take one.</br><a  href="h8.php">Hindi translator voice</a></br><a  href="8.php">English translator voice</a>
